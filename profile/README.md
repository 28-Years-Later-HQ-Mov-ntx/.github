## 🎬 What’s the Movìé About?

This one’s not your typical Predator flick. **28 Years Later** goes full animation and dives deep into the **hunter’s bloody past** with three wild, standalone stories:

### 🛡️ The Shield  
Set in Viking times. A warrior mom and her son chase revenge, but guess who shows up? Yep. The Predator.

### ⚔️ The Sword  
Feudal Japan. A ninja vs. his samurai brother — but that duel gets gatecrashed by the galaxy’s deadliest third party.

### 💥 The Bullet  
WWII pilot stumbles across something not in the history books. Spoiler: It's got claws, cloaking tech, and zero chill.
